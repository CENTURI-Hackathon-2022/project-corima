this dataset comes from Nathanael Tan Yi-Hsuen, National University of Singapore.

like the main corpus, the YM and topo images represent young's modulus (elasticity) and height maps of AFM scans taken at various locations of our sample. matching filenames are taken at the same point.

the CF folder contains an image of the sample taken using confocal laser scannning microscopy, which creates a 3D image stack of the sample. the intensity represents the cell membrane as it is tagged with a fluorescent protein. there is also an image of a sub-surface projection of the sample which gives you an idea of where the cells are. you are encouraged to produce your own projection and investigate the effect of different projection methods.

if you require further explanation of the data, I would be happy to explain. you can contact me at n.tan.yh@nus.edu.sg or simply on Slack if you are there. please bear in mind I am in Singapore currently (GMT+8) and so may take some time to respond depending on time of day.
